Benchmark Datasets
=====================

SeisBench facilitates the downloading of a suite of publicly available seismic waveform datasets
for training of machine learning algorithms. An overview of the contents of each dataset is below,
along with the corresponding citation.

The :py:class:`~seisbench.data.aq2009.AQ2009` dataset contains
the aftershock sequence of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake (6.1 Mw),
a seismic event of significant impact and damage in the South-Central Apennines
region. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for aftershock characterization
using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. For more information see Valoroso et al. (2013): https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrb.50130

The dataset contains:
 * 254 days of aftershocks (2009-04-06 up to 2009-12-20).
 * 63,704 earthquakes.
 * 1,258,006 3-component traces cut of 70 seconds.
 * Absolute (HypoEllipse) and relative (HypoDD) locations.
 * 3 seismic networks (MN, IV, XJ) for a total of 67 stations.
 * Multiple P and S pick arrivals (up to 8 per cut) that allow improvements in current Machine Learning algorithms development and analysis.
 * 201 metadata fields providing information on the station, trace, source, path, and data quality.
 * Waveforms and metadata information on both digital units and ground motion.

Depending on user needs and case study, the dataset can be accessed using the following classes:
:py:class:`~seisbench.data.aq2009.AQ2009Counts` to upload waveforms in digital units.
:py:class:`~seisbench.data.aq2009.AQ2009GM` to upload waveforms in ground motion (with instrument response removed)

.. figure::  ../_static/ceed_overview.png
   :align:   center

The California Earthquake Event Dataset (:py:class:`~seisbench.data.ceed.CEED`),
compiles records from the Northern (NCEDC) and Southern (SCEDC) California Earthquake Data Centers.
The dataset contains waveforms from ~650,000 events for a total of 4.1 million traces.
It covers the years from 1987 to 2023. Each traces contains manually labels P and S arrivals.
In addition, the dataset features rich metadata. Several metadata columns have the suffix ``_list``.
These contain a variable amount of data points and are used, for example, to describe additional phase arrivals in
traces. The dataset comes with a chronological train/dev/test split.
As of now, there is no direct way of using this information in SeisBench, but the information is contained
in the metadata. Further details on how to use the dataset, also without SeisBench, are available on the HuggingFace
site: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI4EPS/CEED.

GEOFON
------

.. figure::  ../_static/geofon_mapplot.png
   :align:   center

As part of its effort to measure and characterize relevant seismicity world-wide in real time, the GEOFON earthquake monitoring serivce acquires and analyses waveform data of over 800, globally distributed seismic stations.
Besides automatic processing, manual analysis, especially onset re-picking, is performed routinely whenever necessary to improve the location quality.
Usually only few picks are manual re-picked.
However, in order to collect reference picks to improve automatic picking, the P arrivals of some events are comprehensively re-picked by an experienced analyst, irrespective of the presence or quality of automatic picks.
For local and near-regional events also S onsets have been picked and for a small fraction both Pn and Pg are included.
For teleseismic events almost no S onsets have been picked.
Depth phases have been picked occasionally but not comprehensively.
In total, there are ~275,000 waveform examples.
The magnitudes of the events comprising this dataset range from about 2 to 9, with the bulk of the manually picked events being intermediate to large events (M 5-7).
Regional events with smaller magnitudes are mostly in Europe and northern Chile.
The time range covers 2009 to 2013.

NEIC
----

The National Earthquake Information Centre (NEIC) benchmark dataset comprises ~1.3 million seismic phase arrivals with
global source-station paths. As information on the trace start-time and station information is missing for this dataset,
it is stored in the SeisBench format, but without this normally required information.
