SeisBench Model API
===================

Overview
-------------------------

SeisBench offers the abstract class :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.WaveformModel` that every SeisBench model should subclass.
This class offers two core functions, ``annotate`` and ``classify``.
Both of the functions are automatically generated based on configurations and submethods implemented in the specific model.
The :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.SeisBenchModel` bridges the gap between the pytorch interface of the models and the obspy interface common in seismology.
It automatically assembles obspy streams into pytorch tensors and reassembles the results into streams.
It also takes care of batch processing.
Computations can be run on GPU by simply moving the model to GPU.

The ``annotate`` function takes an obspy stream object as input and returns annotations as stream again.
For example, for picking models the output would be the characteristic functions, i.e., the pick probabilities over time.

.. code-block:: python

    stream = obspy.read("my_waveforms.mseed")
    annotations = model.annotate(stream)  # Returns obspy stream object with annotations

The ``classify`` function also takes an obspy stream as input, but in contrast to the ``annotate`` function returns discrete results.
The structure of these results might be model dependent.
For example, a pure picking model will return a list of picks, while a picking and detection model might return a list of picks and a list of detections.

.. code-block:: python

    stream = obspy.read("my_waveforms.mseed")
    outputs = model.classify(stream)  # Returns a list of picks
    print(outputs)

Both ``annotate`` and ``classify`` can be supplied with waveforms from multiple stations at once and will automatically handle the correct grouping of the traces.

Loading pretrained models
-------------------------
For annotating waveforms in a meaningful way, trained model weights are required.
SeisBench offers a range of pretrained model weights through a common interface.
Model weights are downloaded on the first use and cached locally afterwards.
For some model weights, multiple versions are available.
For details on accessing these, check the documentation at :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.SeisBenchModel.from_pretrained`.

.. code-block:: python

    import seisbench.models as sbm

    sbm.PhaseNet.list_pretrained()                  # Get available models
    model = sbm.PhaseNet.from_pretrained("geofon")  # Load the model trained on GEOFON

Pretrained models can not only be used for annotating data, but also offer a great starting point for transfer learning.

Speeding up model application
-----------------------------

When applying models to large datasets, run time is often a major concern.
Here are a few tips to make your model run faster.

 - Run on GPU. Execution on GPU is usually faster, even though exact speed-ups vary between models. However, we note
   that running on GPU is not necessarily the most economic option. For example, in cloud applications it might be
   cheaper (and equally fast) to pay for a handful of CPU machines to annotate a large dataset than for a GPU machine.
 - Use a large `batch_size`. This parameter can be passed as an optional argument to all models.
   Especially on GPUs, larger batch sizes lead to faster annotations. As long as the batch fits into (GPU) memory,
   it might be worth increasing the batch size.
 - If you are using torch in version 2.0 or newer, compile your model. It's a simple as running `model = torch.compile(model)`.
   The compilation will take some time but if you are annotating large amounts of waveforms, it should pay off quickly.
   Note that there are many options for compile that might influence the performance gains considerably.
 - Load data in parallel while executing the model using the asyncio interface, i.e., `annotate_asyncio` and `classify_asyncio`.
   This is usually substantially faster because data loading is IO-bound while the actual annotation is compute-bound.
 - While SeisBench can automatically resample the waveforms, it can be faster to do the resampling manually beforehand.
   SeisBench uses obspy routines for resampling, which (as of 2023) are not parallelised. Check the required sampling
   rate with `model.sampling_rate`. Alternative routines are available, e.g., in the Pyrocko library.

Models integrated into SeisBench
--------------------------------

You don't have to build models from scratch if you don't want to. SeisBench integrates the following notable models from the literature
for you to use. Again, as they inherit from the common SeisBench model interface, all these deep learning models are constructed through
PyTorch. Where possible, the original trained weights are imported and made available. These can be accessed via the ``from_pretrained``
method. For a more in-depth explanation, see the :ref:`examples`.

Currently integrated models are capable of earthquake detection and phase picking, waveform denoising,
depth estimation, and low-frequency earthquake phase picking.
Furthermore, with SeisBench you can build ML models to perform general seismic tasks such as magnitude and
source parameter estimation, hypocentre determination etc.
