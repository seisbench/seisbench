SeisBench Model API
===================

Overview
-------------------------

SeisBench offers the abstract class :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.WaveformModel` that every SeisBench model should subclass.
This class offers two core functions, ``annotate`` and ``classify``.
Both of the functions are automatically generated based on configurations and submethods implemented in the specific model.
The :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.SeisBenchModel` bridges the gap between the pytorch interface of the models and the obspy interface common in seismology.
It automatically assembles obspy streams into pytorch tensors and reassembles the results into streams.
It also takes care of batch processing.
Computations can be run on GPU by simply moving the model to GPU.

The ``annotate`` function takes an obspy stream object as input and returns annotations as stream again.
For example, for picking models the output would be the characteristic functions, i.e., the pick probabilities over time.

.. code-block:: python

    stream = obspy.read("my_waveforms.mseed")
    annotations = model.annotate(stream)  # Returns obspy stream object with annotations

The ``classify`` function also takes an obspy stream as input, but in contrast to the ``annotate`` function returns discrete results.
The structure of these results might be model dependent.
For example, a pure picking model will return a list of picks, while a picking and detection model might return a list of picks and a list of detections.

.. code-block:: python

    stream = obspy.read("my_waveforms.mseed")
    picks = model.classify(stream)  # Returns a list of picks
    for pick in picks:
        print(pick)

Both ``annotate`` and ``classify`` can be supplied with waveforms from multiple stations at once and will automatically handle the correct grouping of the traces.
For details on how to build your own model with SeisBench, check the documentation of :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.WaveformModel`.
For details on how to apply models, check out the :ref:`examples`.

Loading pretrained models
-------------------------
For annotating waveforms in a meaningful way, trained model weights are required.
SeisBench offers a range of pretrained model weights through a common interface.
Model weights are downloaded on the first use and cached locally afterwards.
For some model weights, multiple versions are available.
For details on accessing these, check the documentation at :py:class:`~seisbench.models.base.SeisBenchModel.from_pretrained`.

.. code-block:: python

    import seisbench.models as sbm

    sbm.GPD.list_pretrained()                  # Get available models
    model = sbm.GPD.from_pretrained("geofon")  # Load the model trained on GEOFON

Pretrained models can not only be used for annotating data, but also offer a great starting point for transfer learning.

Models integrated into SeisBench
--------------------------------

You don't have to build models from scratch if you don't want to. SeisBench integrates the following notable models from the literature
for you to use. Again, as they inherit from the common SeisBench model interface, all these deep learning models are constructed through
PyTorch. Where possible, the original trained weights are imported and made available. These can be accessed via the ``from_pretrained``
method. For a more in-depth explanation, see the :ref:`examples`.

Currently integrated models are limited to picking and detection works, but you can build ML models in SeisBench to perform general seismic tasks such as:
magnitude and source parameter estimation, hypocentre determination etc.
